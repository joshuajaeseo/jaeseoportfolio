                <p>Our client, a therapist at the ShirleyRyan Abilitylab, approached our team with a challenge: enable hemiplegic and tetraplegic individuals with weak motor skills to independently don a face mask.</p>

            <article class="pagegallery">
                <p>Our key requirements for our solution was to prioritize the independence of the user and to ensure optimal hygiene through securely fitting the mask. Tetraplegic and hemiplegic individuals are more susceptible to COVID and other diseases so hygiene was a top priority.</p>

                    <p>Instead, our user feedback highlighted a clear solution: a prototype our team had written off as unfeasible due to its aesthetics.</p>

                <p><b>Mask Hooks.</b> Born out of desperation to have three prototypes, our team was sure wearing a hat with two command hooks would look too ridiculous to be seriously considered. Yet it performed the best in helping our user don a mask and making our user feel comfortable.</p>

                <p>I learned a very important lesson that day on the importance of user feedback. All of my ideas need to be tested out by my users, since users understand the problem better than me.</p>
