                <h3>From personal experience our team had identified weak paper grocery bags as a problem space, but the insights from grocers using the bags on a daily basis piqued our interest.</h3>

                <h3>The product requirements of durability, sustainability, comfort, and economics were drawn from our surveys, user interviews, and patent research.</h3>

                <h3>The objective of the tests were to find the point of structural failure for each bag. The breaking points were then plotted.</h3>

                <h3>From these tests two frontrunners emerged, but although the double-handle bags performed the best, the increased complexity in manufacturing led to sticker-handle bags as the final product.</h3>
